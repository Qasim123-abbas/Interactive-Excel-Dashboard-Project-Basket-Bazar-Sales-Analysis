# Interactive-Excel-Dashboard-Project-Basket-Bazar-Sales-Analysis
I recently completed this end-to-end Excel Sales Analysis Dashboard for Basket Bazar, and it has been an amazing learning experience.

🔍 Through this project, I explored and practiced:
✅ Data cleaning & preparation
✅ Using Excel formulas for analysis
✅ Creating interactive slicers & filters
✅ Building KPI cards (Total Sales, Avg. Sales, Orders, Quantity)
✅ Visual storytelling through charts (Pie, Bar, Column, Trend analysis)
✅ Designing a user-friendly & professional dashboard

Some key insights from this dashboard:
📌 Sales trends by item types & locations
📌 Year-over-year sales growth visualization
📌 Top contributing categories & customer segments

This project not only sharpened my Excel and data visualization skills, but also gave me a deeper understanding of how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights for decision-making.

💡 My biggest takeaway: Data tells a story, but the way we design dashboards decides how clearly that story is understood.

Excited to keep learning more advanced tools like Power BI, SQL, and AI-driven analytics to level up my data journey! 🚀
